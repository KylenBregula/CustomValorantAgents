# My_Valorant_Agent4

I am always fascinated about agent design in Valorant. It is the ultimate challenge of using your creativity against the constraints and rules of Valorant.
The constraints are there to keep agent balance in check and to keep the game healthy for the long term.

Alley:

Thought Process:
Duelists are meant to take first contact for your team, however typically this is supported with their team behind them assisting with info or flash utility. What if there was a duelist that pursued enemy contact without allies? This is where Alley comes into play, with her signature ability Hush, This allows her to take space faster than other agents without being noticed. This can lead to a pick for their team and having them call their team to rotate. With an agent that is meant to sneak around quietly what is some util that can aid her in this goal. There are 3 ways to be located in valorant. The first two ways are through auditory recognition or visual perception auditory recognition by enemy players. The third way is by utility like Cypher trips and Sova recon. So if we enable alley to counter all 3 ways then that would be a good kit meant for sneaking around. Their signature handles the first way, with visual perception they can either be invisible or something is blocking line of sight between Alley and enemies or util. Having stealth for a basic ability is too strong so smokes it is. This smoke can toggle between run speed and walking speed, both help Alley depending on the situation. She can also place it leading to more mind games on where she can be. Now the final way is finding a way around util. In higher level of valorant play Sova’s shock bolt is very unique to the game because it is one of the few fast dealy damaging abilities in the game.This is lead to it being used as a util breaker at the entrance of sites. Therefore Alley should have something similar to get past util easier. Every duelist ultimate helps with combat or entering a site, however Alley should not have something like that because that means you are announcing to the whole lobby they are about to sneak, which is counter intuitive. Therefore the ultimate should be something after Alley does her sneaky business. That is where the teleport allies ability comes into play as if Alley gets a pick from solo rotating enemy typically they will call a rotate to their site now, so this ultimate helps with that. 

Hush (E): ACTIVATE to become hushed for a limited time. Once hushed, Alley will not create any noise an enemy can hear. Hush charge resets every two kills.

Wakeup (Q): INSTANTLY throw a shock grenade. Upon hitting a surface it detonates and damages players nearby.

Tiptoe (C): EQUIP a ball of smoke. FIRE to send the smoke moving forward and through walls. ALT FIRE to place an inactive smoke. USE to transform an inactive smoke into a ball of smoke and send it forward. ALT FIRE Toggles between the speed of the smoke

Backdoor (X): EQUIP an energy portal. FIRE to start channeling, Allies have an option with INTERACT to teleport to the designated point Alley has started channeling.

Tomb: 

Thought Process:
I love clone abilities in games neeko (LOL), yoru (Valorant), mirage (Apex Legends), and Alibi (Rainbow Six Siege) to name a few. So I believe valorant can fit well with an agent like this. There are 2 ways to stop enemies from pushing from point A to B. One way is to threaten their life for the round through abilities (killjoy, Cypher) or guns (Chamber). The other is to slow them or physically stop them from going in the first place (Sage, Deadlock, Vyse). So far there is not an agent that asks the question where they are on site, unless you have Viper’s ultimate vipers pit. So the first ability is the clone, the issue with having a clone ability that spawns on top tomb and that is it. This can lead to stale gameplay as it can only be used defensively and does not allow for too much creative use. That is why we first control is like a skye dog for # seconds and have it perform those actions that it did when used. When it is first being used enemies cannot see the clone first recording its movement as that will make the clone too obvious. We also don't want the clone ability to see enemies or util it will become a recon tool which we do not want. The second trip is essentially Astra’s gravity well, while enemies are in it they are trying to move however when you see something swinging out to kill you the player's instinct is to stop moving and try to shoot whatever it is swinging. With Tomb is it most likely being a clone leading them to be stunned in a single spot for Tomb to shoot back. The Sandstorm ability is used to lurk around your site playing mind games and making the enemies guess where you are. “Are you in your smoke or a clone just standing in a corner”. I would say for counter play if an enemy were to walk up to a clone or knife it then the clone will destroy itself causing no downside to the enemy. Having a clone stay in a corner the entire round making enemies second guess themselves is too strong to have. The ult is simple and it is to create more mischief as you can get very create with the clones being it fake reload or faking a defuse. This ability alone is enough to be an ult itself. 

Mirage (E): INSTANTLY send out and take control of a clone. While in control of the clone, you can not see enemies and utility. Enemies can not see this clone either. After a limited time the clone teleports back to when you initially controlled in the position you are in. USE to have the clone move and perform actions you previously did when you had control over it. RE-USE the ability to cut the control over the clone short. An enemy is concussed if they destroy a mirage. 

Sinkhole (Q): EQUIP a covert marker. FIRE to deploy a marker that pops when enemies get in range. After a delay a sandpit is created. Players in the area are pulled toward the center before it explodes, making all players still trapped inside revealed.

SandStorm (C): EQUIP a smoke to throw that perpetually remains throughout the round. RE-USE the ability to create a sandstorm for a limited time. This smoke Nearsights players and clouds minimap. 

Ascend (X): INSTANTLY get two charges of mirage.

GOALS:
- Fixed known bugs I have with the code
- Learning unreal engine niagara particle system for better effects on abilties
- Improve on the project with a mixture of C++ Coding
- Remodel / Revamp the project in which allows for easier time adding more agents
- Fix Lighting and shading of maps
